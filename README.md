# SCHAT
During the SCHAT project research was conducted on how the interface of a track &amp; trace system (a
system used to locate missing items) should be designed. This project was elaborated whilst using
the V-model. At first a study was conducted. The results of this study were used to create three
possible interfaces. These interfaces were then tested by nurses and caretakers from a single care
home. With the results from these tests, the interfaces were optimized after which a selection
procedure followed. During this procedure, the research team looked at which interface was tested
best: this turned out to be the interface with categories.

This prototype was focused on database management and search functionality for the interface.
